    "> - Utilize American Trends Panel Datasets (accessable <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shankanater/american-trends-panel-pewresearch/download\">here</a>), with Natural Language Processing techniques to assess and attempt to predict sentiment toward particular topics.\n",
    "> - This will culminate into a well-built well-documented jupyter notebook that contains our process and derivation of these predictions.\n",

    "> - Utilize tabulated statistical data aquired from Pew Research American Trends Surveys.\n",
    "> - Prepare, explore and formulate hypthoesis about the data.\n",
    "> - Build models that can predict future American sentiment toward certain topics, and utilize hyperparameter optimization and feature engineering to improve validation model performance prior to evaluating on test data.\n",

    "> - A clearly named final notebook. This notebook will contain more detailed processes other than noted within the README and have abstracted scripts to assist on readability.\n",
    "> - A `README.md` that explains what the project is, how to reproduce the project, and notes about the project.\n",
